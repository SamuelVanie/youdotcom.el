# youdotcom.el

A simple package to use Youdotcom search engine from Emacs.
Pretty neat alternative to eww in emacs.

*N.B: Remember that Youdotcom search is a search engine not a chatbot.*

## ‚ùì Why?

I wanted to use Youdotcom search engine from Emacs, so I wrote this package.
The You API is very simple and cheap to use, so I thought it would be an alternative for people who still want to use a search engine instead of chatbots.
You will no more need to filter the results by yourself on the web and directly get the results inside of Emacs without leaving it.

You can also use it as a simple web browser, but this is not the spirit of an emacs user, right ?

*N.B: Do not forget to check the pricing of the You search engine API.*


## üíæ Installation

### Straigt

```elisp
(use-package youdotcom
  :straight (youdotcom :type git :host github :repo "SamuelVanie/youdotcom.el"))
```

### Doom Emacs

```elisp
(package! youdotcom
  :recipe (:host github :repo "SamuelVanie/youdotcom.el"))
```


### MELPA

To be done...


## üîë Obtaining an API key

You need to obtain an API key from [You.com](https://api.you.com/).
Go to that website and get the Web Search API key, the Web LLM integration is not yet supported (I'm planning to add it in the future).


## üíª Usage

You will have to set the API key in your init file:

```elisp
(setq youdotcom-api-key "YOUR_API_KEY")
```

Then you can use the following commands:

- `youdotcom-enter` : Will start the client and open the prompt for you to enter your query.
You can setup a keybinding for this command. (e.g. `(global-set-key (kbd "C-c y") 'youdotcom-enter)`)

In the prompt, you can use the following commands:

- `/help` : Will display the help message.
- `/clear` : Will clear the buffer.
- `/quit` : Stop the search engine's session and close the buffer.

*NB: You can change the number of results displayed by changing the variable `youdotcom-number-of-results` (default is 1).*
